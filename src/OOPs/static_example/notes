1) -> static variables are independent of object . A variable who is declared as static during declaration works
 same for his every sub-child.

2) -> Don't access, modify, declare, change static variable via object name it will work butstill don't do it .Use it
 via class name.

3) -> You can declare variables or methods/functions as static e.g. public static void main().

4) -> Static means you can make method/function or variables and use them without creating the objects of that class.

5) -> We can run main function inside a class because it declared as along with static, hence we don't have to create a
object to access main function.

6) -> We know that something which is not static, belongs to an object. We can't access any object, property, variable
inside a static function which is not declared as static.

7) -> You can't access non static stuff without referencing their instances in a static context.

8) -> Static block will only run once, when the first object is created i.e. when the class is loaded for the first time.

9) -> Outside classes can not be declared as static.

10) -> If a class is declared inside another class then it becomes dependent on it, hence we can't access it inside any
static method/function but when a class isn't declared within any another class then it can be access within static
 method/function as now it doesn't depend on any other class or object.

11) -> We know object are declare during runtime where as static variable/method/function/class are declared during
compile time.
