The Enum in Java is a data type which contains a fixed set of constants.

It can be used for days of the week (SUNDAY, MONDAY, TUESDAY, WEDNESDAY, THURSDAY, FRIDAY, and SATURDAY) , directions
(NORTH, SOUTH, EAST, and WEST), season (SPRING, SUMMER, WINTER, and AUTUMN or FALL), colors (RED, YELLOW, BLUE, GREEN,
WHITE, and BLACK) etc. According to the Java naming conventions, we should have all constants in capital letters. So,
we have enum constants in capital letters.

Java Enums can be thought of as classes which have a fixed set of constants (a variable that does not change). The Java
enum constants are static and final implicitly. It is available since JDK 1.5.

Enums are used to create our own data type like classes. The enum data type (also known as Enumerated Data Type) is used
to define an enum in Java. Unlike C/C++, enum in Java is more powerful. Here, we can define an enum either inside the
class or outside the class.

Java Enum internally inherits the Enum class, so it cannot inherit any other class, but it can implement many
interfaces. We can have fields, constructors, methods, and main methods in Java enum.

Points to remember for Java Enum:
Enum improves type safety
Enum can be easily used in switch
Enum can be traversed
Enum can have fields, constructors and methods
Enum may implement many interfaces but cannot extend any class because it internally extends Enum class
