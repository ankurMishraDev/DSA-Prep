a) User Defined
b) In-built

In-built packages:
a) lang
b) Input - Output

Advantage of Java Package
1) Java package is used to categorize the classes and interfaces so that they can be easily maintained.
2) Java package provides access protection.
3) Java package removes naming collision.

How to access package from another package?
There are three ways to access the package from outside the package.
import package.*;
import package.classname;
fully qualified name.
1) Using packagename.*
If you use package.* then all the classes and interfaces of this package will be accessible but not subpackages.
The import keyword is used to make the classes and interface of another package accessible to the current package.
2) Using packagename.classname
If you import package.classname then only declared class of this package will be accessible.
[Note: If you import a package, subpackages will not be imported.]

Package inside the package is called the subpackage. It should be created to categorize the package further.
